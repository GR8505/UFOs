## Executive Overview ##
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was very interesting indeed band I encountered some issues in debugging. While I was 
successful in developing the page as intended by my employer, there was an issue with the syntax 
for filtering.

In adding the link to the D3.js CDN and the file paths for the data.js and app.js files to the 
index.html file, the refreshed page did not produce any filtered data in the table. Deeper analysis 
and inspection of both the app.js and index.html files were required to resolve project failure.

I eventually realized that one block of syntax wasn't closed and rectified the issue.

## Objectives ##
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Add filters for the following:
  - Date
  - City
  - State
  - Country
  - Shape
2) Project description in Readme file
3) Updated app.js file
4) Clean website with fully functioning filter table

## Results ##

These are the links to my [app.js](https://github.com/GR8505/UFOs/blob/master/static/js/app.js) and [html](https://github.com/GR8505/UFOs/blob/master/index.html) files:

## Key Takeaway points ##
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) I definitely need more practice with html, css and javascript
2) Indentation is key to coding
